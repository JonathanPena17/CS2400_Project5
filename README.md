Graph Representation:

We used both adjacency martrix and list:
1. Pass the number of vertices whether we decided to use MatrixJraph.java or GraphList.java.
2. Set the labels of the vertices.
3. Add the edges to each vertices.
4. Used LinkedQueue.java to hold result of the methods getBreathFirstTraversal() or getDepthFirstTraversal().
5. Use methods printTraversalLabels_forList() or printTraversalLabels_forMatrix () to print out the traversal output order.
